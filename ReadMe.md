# CloudFormation Hands-on Projects

This repository contains my hands-on CloudFormation templates as I'm learning the service.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

*   Track my progress as I learn CloudFormation.
*   Provide examples of simple CloudFormation templates.
*   Serve as a reference for future projects.

## Contents

Each folder in this repository represents a specific CloudFormation project or exercise. Inside each folder, you will find:

*   A CloudFormation template file (`.yaml` or `.json`).
*   (Optionally) A brief `README.md` file with a description for the exercise.

## Projects

Here is a brief overview of the different projects:

*   **ec2-basic**: This project creates a simple EC2 instance, with security group, and install a basic web server using user data.
*   *(Add more projects here as you go, briefly describing each one)*

## Getting Started

To use these templates, you'll need:

1.  An AWS account.
2.  The AWS CLI installed and configured.
3.  Familiarity with basic CloudFormation concepts.

To deploy a template:

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the template you want to deploy.
2.  Use the AWS CLI to create a stack:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <your-stack-name> --template-body file://<template-file>.yaml --region <your-aws-region>
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <your-stack-name> --template-body file://<template-file>.json --region <your-aws-region>
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual values)*

## Notes

*   These templates are for learning purposes and may not be suitable for production environments.
*   I am actively learning CloudFormation, so the templates may evolve over time.
*   I welcome any feedback or suggestions!
